# Mom-Birthday-Greeting-App
This app presents different texts, GIFs & photos to greet my mother on her birthday, and hopefully make her laugh.

You can see the design from [For You Section](#for-you)
## Frames

You can view the frames from the [PDF file](/Design%20Files/App%20-%20Design%20Prototype.pdf)

But [PDF file](/Design%20Files/App%20-%20Design%20Prototype.pdf) can not include GIF, for viewing GIF you can view from one of below:

1. From my [figma link](https://www.figma.com/proto/HkUSI31MVv0qXiG7rw6Zb7/App?node-id=1%3A58&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2). This link also let's you give you a draft of inrection to expect from the app.

2. Or you can just use my [.fig file](/Design%20Files/App%20-%20Design%20Prototype.fig). This can imadiately give you acess to all my design and you can edit them if you want.


## Progress

### Calender

__Feb. 28'23__: All of the design were created and figma prototype.

__Mar. 1'23__: I watched few videos from my YT playlist, which I talked in this [section](#youtube---tutorials).

__Mar. 2'23__: I created the GitHub Repo. and _commit_: 7a02a05, 09db990, e1d3be8 in Branch [Version 1](https://github.com/Kumar-P05/Mom-Birthday-Greeting-App/tree/Version-1)


### Tools

I used some Help tools, which I talked in this [section](#help)

[Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio): For coding

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/): For designing


### Help

I found designs and inspiration mostly from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). But few of them were from [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community), [Behance](https://www.behance.net/), [Screenlane](https://screenlane.com/) & [Sketchappsources](https://www.sketchappsources.com/).

Now for my second page, which is third page in my [design](/Design%20Files/App%20-%20Design%20Prototype.fig) & [PDF file](/Design%20Files/App%20-%20Design%20Prototype.pdf) and [design link](https://www.figma.com/proto/HkUSI31MVv0qXiG7rw6Zb7/App?node-id=1%3A58&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2), I was looking for Background image. I was trying to find image similar to my ispiration demo design but couldn't. So in the end I took the screenshot of upper part of demo design app's background where nothing was present in the foreground than I used [AI Photo Tools](#Photo) to create me a image. 



#### AI

##### Photo

[Neural.love](https://neural.love/): I used this to basically uncrop (or Outpainting) the images. I only used free credits.

[Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/): Used this to enahance, unblur and edit photos. I only used free credits.


##### Text

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): Used this to edit, generate in some cases, the text for App or docs. Note This Readme __was not__ edited by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) in anyway, it was written by me completely.



##### Code

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): General use. Most of time for debugging purpose. Sometime used to understand code. Few of the time used to generate a part of code too.

IntelliJ IDEA ([android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)): Default Code completion was activated and used while coding. 

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot): This was paid and used while development.


#### Youtube - Tutorials

I've created this [Youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCqikY1Z3O6E7F5Scg8F6gu4h4TZeXoCg), which contained every video that I watched for creating this Project. Note that I've removed every video that wasn't helpful for this Project. And finaly I would like to shoutout to [Youtuber Philipp Lackner](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner), as you might have noticed that all of the videos in the [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCqikY1Z3O6E7F5Scg8F6gu4h4TZeXoCg) is from [him](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner) and as matter of fact acording to me [he](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner) is the best youtuber for Android Development and most of time I only watch [him](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner).
