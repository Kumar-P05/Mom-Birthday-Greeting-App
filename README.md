# Mom-Birthday-Greeting-App
This app presents different texts, GIFs & photos to greet my mother on her birthday, and hopefully make her laugh.

> During development I was not able to find a way to intreage GIF and espcially MP4 as many of the animation were based on that. So in the end, due to lack of skill I decided to just show the prototype. The prototype only include 1 photo of my mother so I creted another design from it and added all of the photos. This is private but original one will be still availbale. And if you guys do create it, don't hesitate create pull request. With that said this development is postponed!

You can see the design from [For You Section](#for-you)
## Frames

You can view the frames from the [PDF file](/Design%20Files/App%20-%20Design%20Prototype.pdf)

But [PDF file](/Design%20Files/App%20-%20Design%20Prototype.pdf) can not include GIF, for viewing GIF you can view from one of below:

1. From my [figma link](https://www.figma.com/proto/HkUSI31MVv0qXiG7rw6Zb7/App?node-id=1%3A58&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2). This link also let's you give you a draft of inrection to expect from the app.

2. Or you can just use my [.fig file](/Design%20Files/App%20-%20Design%20Prototype.fig). This can imadiately give you acess to all my design and you can edit them if you want.

### Tools

I used some Help tools, which I talked in this [section](#help)

[Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio): For coding

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/): For designing


### Help

I found designs and inspiration mostly from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). But few of them were from [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community), [Behance](https://www.behance.net/), [Screenlane](https://screenlane.com/) & [Sketchappsources](https://www.sketchappsources.com/).

Now for my second page, which is third page in my [design](/Design%20Files/App%20-%20Design%20Prototype.fig) & [PDF file](/Design%20Files/App%20-%20Design%20Prototype.pdf) and [design link](https://www.figma.com/proto/HkUSI31MVv0qXiG7rw6Zb7/App?node-id=1%3A58&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2), I was looking for Background image. I was trying to find image similar to my ispiration demo design but couldn't. So in the end I took the screenshot of upper part of demo design app's background where nothing was present in the foreground than I used [AI Photo Tools](#Photo) to create me a image. 



#### AI

##### Photo

[Neural.love](https://neural.love/): I used this to basically uncrop (or Outpainting) the images. I only used free credits.

[Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/): Used this to enahance, unblur and edit photos. I only used free credits.


##### Text

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): Used this to edit, generate in some cases, the text for App or docs. Note This Readme __was not__ edited by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) in anyway, it was written by me completely.



##### Code

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): General use. Most of time for debugging purpose. Sometime used to understand code. Few of the time used to generate a part of code too.

IntelliJ IDEA ([android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)): Default Code completion was activated and used while coding. 

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot): This was paid and used while development.


#### Youtube - Tutorials

I've created this [Youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCqikY1Z3O6E7F5Scg8F6gu4h4TZeXoCg), which contained every video that I watched for creating this Project. Note that I've removed every video that wasn't helpful for this Project. And finaly I would like to shoutout to [Youtuber Philipp Lackner](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner), as you might have noticed that all of the videos in the [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCqikY1Z3O6E7F5Scg8F6gu4h4TZeXoCg) is from [him](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner) and as matter of fact acording to me [he](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner) is the best youtuber for Android Development and most of time I only watch [him](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner).
