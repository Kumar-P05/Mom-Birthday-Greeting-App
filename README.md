# Mom-Birthday-Greeting-App
This app present difrent texts, GIFs & photos to greet my mother on her mother, and hopefully make her laugh.

The app layout is simple and like potrait presentation. And change is done with either button or slide.

## Frames

You can view the frames from the PDF file.{}

But PDF file{} can not include GIF, for viewing GIF you can view from one of below:

1. From the my [figma link](https://www.figma.com/proto/HkUSI31MVv0qXiG7rw6Zb7/App?node-id=1%3A58&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2). This link also let's you give you a draft of inrection to expect from the app.

2. Or you can just use my .fig{} file. This can imadiately give you acess to all my design and you can edit them if you want.


## Progress

### Calender

Feb. 28'23: All of the design was created and figma prototype.

Mar. 1: I watched Few videos from my YT playlist, which I talked in this section{}.

Mar. 2: I created the GitHub Repo. and commit: \[fun{}]


### Tools

I used some Help tools, which I talked in this section {}

[Android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio): For coding

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/): For designing


### Help

I found designs and inspiration mostly from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). But few of them were from [Figma community](https://www.figma.com/community), [Behance](https://www.behance.net/), [Screenlane](https://screenlane.com/) & [Sketchappsources](https://www.sketchappsources.com/).

Now for my second page, which is third page in my design{} & PDF file{} and [design link](https://www.figma.com/proto/HkUSI31MVv0qXiG7rw6Zb7/App?node-id=1%3A58&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2), I was looking for Background image. I was trying to find image similar to my ispiration demo design but couldn't. So in the end I took the screenshot of upper part of demo design app background where nothing present in foreground than I my AI/Photo Tools to create me a image. 



#### AI

##### Photo

[Neural.love](https://neural.love/): I used this link to basically uncrop (or Outpainting) the images. I only used free credits.

[Fotor](https://www.fotor.com/): Used this to enahance, unblur and edit photos.


##### Text

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): Used this to edit, generate in some cases, the text for App or docs. Note This Readme was edited by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) but was first of all written by me and there is no change in details, just wording and grammer was improved by [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/).



##### Code

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/): General use. Most of time for debugging purpose. Sometime used to understand code. Few of the time used to generate a part of code too.

IntelliJ IDEA ([android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)): Default Code completion was activated and used while coding. 

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot): This was paid and used while development.


#### Youtube - Tutorials

I've created this Youtube playlist{}, which contained every video that I watched for creating this Project. Note that I've removed every vodeo that wasn't helpful for this Project. And fiannly I would like to shoutout to Youtuber {}, as you might have noticed that all of the videos in the playlist {}is from him and matter of fact acording to me he{} is the best youtuber for Android Development and most of time I only watch him{}.
